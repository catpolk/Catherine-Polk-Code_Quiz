* Catherine-Polk-Code-Quiz

-My motivation was to create an interactive timed quiz that keeps the score and subtracts time from the timer when a user clicks on incorrect answer. 

-I built this project to demonstrate my Java Script, HTML, and CSS skills. 

-This program can solve problems at any educational institution such as school, college, etc. Students can take a timed quiz and for poor performence get lower scores, and get better results if they perform well. 

-I practiced creating different functions and methods, I learned how to compare answers and how to subtract time from timer. 

-The project stand out due to its simplicity.
